Overveiew comments:
-------------------
	I wanted this environment to be as secure as possible, so will be using SNMPv3 as much as possible.  This means there is a password to get access to client, password to get data, and 2 types of encryption.  It will take a little more work, but is worth it


SERVER - Installation of server via script:
-------------------------------------------

-Build Ubunu 18.04 server, 20.04 does not work

SH> wget http://www.observium.org/observium_installscript.sh
SH> chmod +x observium_installscript.sh
SH> sudo ./observium_installscript.sh

-Script will run and enter the following values

Verion: 		1 (Community)
mysql root password:	** IN KEEPASS *

-script will continue, and ask for administrator for application

account name:		admin
Password:		** IN KEEPASS **

SERVER - Installation of WMI agents:
------------------------------------
-Once the server is up and running, and you have some Linux hosts in it, we can add WMI extensions for Windows client management


SH> wget http://packetfence.org/downloads/PacketFence/debian-lastrelease/pool/stretch/w/wmi/libwmiclient1_1.3.14-3_amd64.deb
SH> sudo dpkg -i hlibwmiclient1_1.3.14-3_amd64.deb

SH> wget http://packetfence.org/downloads/PacketFence/debian-lastrelease/pool/stretch/w/wmi/wmi-client_1.3.14-3_amd64.deb
SH> sudo dpkg -i wmi-client_1.3.14-3_amd64.deb

CLIENT - Install and configure SNMP v3 for Redhat / CentOS
----------------------------------------------------------

SH> sudo yum install net-snmp
SH> sudo service snmpd stop

-PASSWORD1 and PASSWORD2 will be replaced with the actual passwords that are stored in KeePass

SH> sudo net-snmp-create-v3-user -ro -A **PASSWORD1** -a SHA -X **PASSWORD1** -x AES monitor

-Edit the following file:

SH> sudo nano /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

-and make the following changes, but replace with actual data:
sysLocation    xx.xxxxxx -xx.xxxxxx ** IN KEEPASS **
sysContact     xxx xxxxxxxx ** IN KEEPASS **

-Optional, add these lines to get more detailed information:

# This line allows Observium to detect the host OS if the distro script is installed
# extend .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.7890.1 distro /usr/local/bin/distro
# This lines allows Observium to detect hardware, vendor and serial
extend .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.7890.2 hardware /bin/cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name
extend .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.7890.3 vendor   /bin/cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor
extend .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.7890.4 serial   /bin/cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_serial
# This line allows Observium to collect an accurate uptime
extend uptime /bin/cat /proc/uptime
# This line enables Observium's ifAlias description injection
#pass_persist .1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18 /usr/local/bin/ifAlias_persist

SH> sudo service snmpd start


Optional: testing to see if SNMP is working

SH> yum install net-snmp-utils
SH> snmpwalk -v3 -u monitor -l authNoPriv -a SHA -x AES -A **PASSWORD1** -X **PASSWORD2** localhost

-This is necessary to open the firewall on RedHat / CentOS
SH> sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=161/udp
SH> sudo firewall-cmd --reload

CLIENT - Install SNMP v3 for Ubuntu
-----------------------------------

-Install SNMP
SH> sudo apt-get -y install snmp snmpd libsnmp-dev

-Stop the service
SH> sudo service snmpd stop

-Create user,PASSWORD1 and PASSWORD2 will be replaced with the actual passwords that are stored in KeePass
sudo net-snmp-config --create-snmpv3-user -ro -A **PASSWORD1** -X **PASSWORD1** -a SHA -x AES monitor

-Edit the following file:
SH> sudo nano /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

-and make the following changes:
sysLocation    xx.xxxxxx -xx.xxxxxx ** IN KEEPASS **
sysContact     xxx xxxxxxxx ** IN KEEPASS **

-and comment out this line:
agentaddress  127.0.0.1,[::1]

-and add this line and save
agentAddress udp:161,udp6:[::1]:161

-Optional, add these lines to get more detailed information:

# This line allows Observium to detect the host OS if the distro script is installed
extend .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.7890.1 distro /usr/local/bin/distro
# This lines allows Observium to detect hardware, vendor and serial
extend .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.7890.2 hardware /bin/cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name
extend .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.7890.3 vendor   /bin/cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor
extend .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.7890.4 serial   /bin/cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_serial
# This line allows Observium to collect an accurate uptime
extend uptime /bin/cat /proc/uptime
# This line enables Observium's ifAlias description injection
#pass_persist .1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18 /usr/local/bin/ifAlias_persist

-Start the service
SH> sudo service snmpd start

CLIENT - Restart of SNMP services to re-establish connection
------------------------------------------------------------

	Sometimes Observium looses connection and a reset of the SNMP servies will repair the issue:

Resetart servies on Redhat / CentOS:
SH> sudo service snmpd restart

Restart servies on Ubuntu:
SH> sudo systemctl restart snmpd

CLIENT - configuration of Dell Printer

-Open a web browser and go to the WebGUI
-Log on as an administrator
-Select 'Settings > Network Settings' from the top bar	
-Look for 'Network Settings, SNMP, SNMPv3'

SERVER - Adding device to monitor
---------------------------------
	After configuring SNMP on the client side, you can add the device to be monitored


Go to [Devices] -> [Add Device]

-Enter the following information in the fields

Hostname: ** IP Address of device to monitor ** 

Protocol version: v3
Transport:		UDP
Port: 			161
Auth Level: 		authPriv
Auth username: 		** IN KEEPASS **
Auth Password: 		** IN KEEPASS **
Auth Algorithm: 	SHA
Crypto Password: 	** IN KEEPASS **
Crypto Algo: 		AES

-When done, click [SAVE], if the sytem can communicate to the client with corrects password and encryption, it will be added.  Anything off and it will not add.

SERVER - Changing IP address of monitored device
------------------------------------------------
	Learned that the preferred method to add devices are to use a DNS name, so if IP changes, system will not be lost.  I don't keep all systems in a local DNS, but add systems by IP address.  In order to do this, work needs to be done at the console level

-Use putty to connect to server
-Logon to system.

SH> sudo bash
ROOT > cd /opt/observium
ROOT > ./rename_device.php OLD_IP NEW_IP
ROOT > exit
