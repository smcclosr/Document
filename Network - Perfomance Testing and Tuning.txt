Network - Perfomance Testing and Tuning
---------------------------------------

Version:	1.00
Date:		2022.01.25
Notes:		Initial Build

	This document will detail the testing and tuning of the network in order to see the limitation, and to improve performance. Currently will be using iperf3 for testing
	
INSTALLATION - Windows
----------------------

	This section will detail how to install the testing tools on windows.  It has been detailed for Windows 2008 R2, Windows 2012, and Windows 10.  Currently there is a firewall issue with starting up a server on Windows 2012, but once resolved will be detailled here
	
PS-ADMIN > choco install iperf3

INSTALLATION - Ubuntu
---------------------


INSTALLATION - TrueNAS
----------------------

INSTALLATION - ESXi
-------------------

RUNNING IPERF3 SERVER - Windows
-------------------------------

CMD> iperf3 -s

TESTING - Extensive testing:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-The following format of the command will generate a heavily saturated connection and will stress it to the limit:

iperf -c 192.168.11.24 -P 16 -w 64k -l 128k -t 30

=========================================================
...
[SUM]   0.00-30.00  sec  29.5 GBytes  8.44 Gbits/sec                  sender
[SUM]   0.00-30.00  sec  29.5 GBytes  8.44 Gbits/sec                  receiver
=========================================================

-much more than just a simple test:

iperf -c 192.168.11.24 -P 16 -w 64k -l 128k -t 30

=========================================================
...
[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth
[  4]   0.00-10.00  sec  5.59 GBytes  4.80 Gbits/sec                  sender
[  4]   0.00-10.00  sec  5.59 GBytes  4.80 Gbits/sec                  receiver
=========================================================

-This would mean that an ESXi internal switch stops at 8.44 Gbits/sec.	
	
TESTING - network bottleneck MOCA adapter
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	There is a MOCA adapter that connects the network from the basement to the bedroom,  While the connection is 100 mbit, the ports on the adapters are only 10 mbit, so that is the limiting factor.  It can be seen if there is a test between a computer in this area (PW-DX360-01, 192.168.11.5) and any guest on the ESXi host (192.168.11.24)

-Start server with section "RUNNING IPERF3 SERVER - Windows" on Windows 10 virtual machine
-run the following command from a machine that is on the other side of the MOCA to connect to that server:
CMD> iperf3 -c 192.168.11.82

=========================================================
...
[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth
[  4]   0.00-10.00  sec   113 MBytes  94.9 Mbits/sec                  sender
[  4]   0.00-10.00  sec   113 MBytes  94.9 Mbits/sec                  receiver
=========================================================
-You will see that no matter which server you connet to, bandwidth will be limited to 94.9 Mbits/sec

TESTING - Newtork bottleneck, Windows 2008R2 machine
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Upon seeing limitation of backups on V28-TEM (192.168.11.114), testing was done, and it looks like there is a limiatation where if Windows 2008R2 is either sending or receving data, the maximum it can handle is about 220 Mbits/sec.
	
-Start server with section "RUNNING IPERF3 SERVER - Windows" on Windows 2008R2 virtual machine
-run the following command on Windows 10 VM to connect to that server:
CMD> iperf3 -c 192.168.11.114

=========================================================
...
[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth
[  4]   0.00-10.00  sec   236 MBytes   198 Mbits/sec                  sender
[  4]   0.00-10.00  sec   236 MBytes   198 Mbits/sec                  receiver
=========================================================

CMD> iperf3 -c 192.168.11.82

=========================================================
...
[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth
[  4]   0.00-10.00  sec   231 MBytes   193 Mbits/sec                  sender
[  4]   0.00-10.00  sec   231 MBytes   193 Mbits/sec                  receiver
=========================================================

-but once change to a Windows 10 iperf3 server, issue goes away:
CMD> iperf3 -c 192.168.11.24

=========================================================
...
[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth
[  4]   0.00-10.00  sec  5.39 GBytes  4.63 Gbits/sec                  sender
[  4]   0.00-10.00  sec  5.39 GBytes  4.63 Gbits/sec                  receiver
=========================================================

-Based upon this evidence, it is recommended that all Windows 2008R2 devices be removed as soon as possible.
