Standard Procedure - Reboot
---------------------------
Version: 1.00
This is a standard repeatable process

- Shut down all Jails
- Shut down all vSphere VMs on iscsi
- Reboot server

Standard Procedure - Install upgrade
------------------------------------
Version: 1.00
- Do 'Procedure - Reboot'
- Go to [System -> Update]
- Install upgrade

Configure - Setting TimeZone
----------------------------
Version: 1.05
NEEDED: <timezone>

-Go to [System -> General]
-Find the setting for 'Timezone' set value to <timezone>

Configure - DNS and Gateway
---------------------------
Version: 1.05
NEEDED: <Nameserver>, <Gateway>

-Go to [Network -> Global Configuration]
-Find the setting for 'Nameserver1, set value to <Nameserver>
-Find the setting for 'IPv4 Default Gateway', set value to <Gateway>
-Click [Save]

Configure - IP address for NIC
------------------------------
Version: 1.05
NEEDED: <interface_name>, <ip_address>, <NetMask>
OPTIONAL: <MTU>

-Go to [Network -> Interfaces]
-Find <interface_name> in the list then click the [>], then [Edit]
-Find the setting 'IP Address' and enter the <ip_address>.
-Find the dropdown for the Netmask, and set to the proper <Netmask>
-Optional: find the setting 'MTU' and enter the <MTU>
-Click [Apply]

Configure - iSCSI setup with Wizard for VMWare
----------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5
REQUIRED: <Name>, <Extent_Type>, <Extent_Device>, <Sharing_Platform>, <Portal>, <DAM>, <DAG>, <IP_Address>, <IP_Port>, <VMWARE_IQN>
OPTIONAL:  <IP_Address>, <IP_Port>

-This procedure has the assumption that the disk is already created before sharing

-Go to [Sharing -> Block Shares (iSCSI)]
-click [Wizard]
-Find the setting 'Name' and enter the <Name>
-Find the setting 'Extent Type' and select the <Extent_Type>
-Find the setting 'Device' and select the <Extent_Device>
-Find the setting 'Sharing Platform' and select <Sharing_Platform>
-Click [Next]
-Find the setting for 'Portal" and select <Portal>
-Find the setting for 'Discovery Authentication Method' and select <DAM>
-Find the setting for 'Discovery Authentication Group' and select <DAG>
-Find the setting for 'IP Address' and enter <IP_Address>
-Find the setting for 'Port' and enter the <IP_Port>
-If there is additional <IP_Address> and <IP_Port> click [Add] button and add them
-Click [Next]
-Click [Next]

-For this section make sure that the 'Adding iSCSI Storage Adapter' from document 'VMware-Jumbo_frames' has been done where <IP_Address>, <IP_Port> has been added.

-Go to [Sharing -> Block Shares (iSCSI)]
-Go to 'Initiators Group'
-Find the line that has the <Name> and click the [...], then [Edit]
-Find the checkmark 'Allow All Initiators' and Uncheck
-Find the box for 'Connected Initiators', then <VMWARE_IQN> and move it to the right
-Optional, if there are other <VMWARE_IQN> that are needed, highlight and move it to the right
-Click [Save]

Configure - iSCSI Extent Change type
------------------------------------
Version: 1.5

This procedure will change the type (Speed) of Extent being presented; it is best to match what the actual disks are so that the initiators knows the performance limitations

REQUIRED: <Extent_name>, <extent_speed>

-Go to [Sharing -> Block Shares (iSCSI)]
-Click [Extents]
-Find the row with the <Extent_Name> then on the right of the row click on the [...] then [Edit]
-Find the setting 'LUN RPM' and select the value as <extent_speed>
-Click [Save]
Procedure - Backup to BackBlaze:
--------------------------------
	In the vSphere environment, there are procedures to backup from the iSCSI LUN to a NFS LUN. This is done becaue cannot backup Iscsi to BackBlaze, only NFS.  This procedure will take care of the configuration to backup the NFS, how the data gets there is handled by the document 'VMware - backup Solution for HOST2 (6.7)"

	Geneating BackBlaze Bucket
	--------------------------
	This will generate a bucket which will hold the data

-Log onto Backblaze.com
-go to [Buckets], 


	Generating BackBlaze Application Key
	------------------------------------
	This will generate the keys needed for TrueNAS to access BackBlaze B2 from TrueNAS

-Log onto Backblaze.com
-go to [App Keys]
-Click on [Add New Application Key] with and enter the following information
--Name of Key: TrueNAS
--Access to Bucket: all
--Type: Read and Write
--File Name Prefix: blank
--Duration: blank

-Collect the KeyID and ApplicationKey, and save it to KeePass.  It will not be shown again.  This information will be needed for next section.

	Adding BackBlaze Cloud Credential to TrueNAS
	--------------------------------------------
	This will take the keys from the previous section and add it to the TrueNAS console

-Log onto TrueNAS System
-Go to [System], [Cloud Credentials]
-Create a new credental with the following values
--Name: BackBlaze-Office
--Provider: BackBlaze B2
--Access ID Key: *Get from BackBlaze Website*
--Application Key: *Get from BackBlaze Website*


SH Task - Getting size of snapshot:
-----------------------------------

-Log onto TrueNAS via putty as root. 
-this command will print out the space listing of pool vdisk01, only show columns 1 and 4, and then filter out any rows that have no snapshots.  While it is not pretty, it will filter for just the data that is needed.  

#SH> zfs list -o space -r vdisk01
SH> zfs list -o space -r vdisk01 | awk '{print $1,$4}' | grep -v "0B"
or 
SH> zfs list -o space -r vdisk01 | awk '{print $1,$4}' | sed '/0B/d'

-this enchanced version will also remove the vdisk01

SH> zfs list -o space -r vdisk01 | awk '{print $1,$4}' | sed 's/vdisk01//i' | sed '/0B/d'

ISSUE 1 - Adding X520 adapter
-----------------------------
-The PCIe adapter is too short, so to get the card installed, need to get another.  Have workaround where install card without the bracket, A little unstable but works.
-Replaced PCIe adapter worked fine.
-Now furthere issue with internal NIC and Gigabit Ethernet, needed to replce with Cheslio CR-422, get 2 x 1GB connections and 2 x 10GBe connections

ISSUE 2 - WebUI thread meter not showing
----------------------------------------

-Upgraded system from 12.0 U3 to U4, and thread utilization is missing from UI.
-Known issue, documented with vendor, will be repaired in future version, not dropping back to U3

ISSUE 3 - no ping reply (NOP-Out) after 5 seconds; dropping connection
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:  2021.07.01

-Seeing it on console of TrueNAS

https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/ctld-continually-exits-read-connection-lost-bug.80933/
-Need to check VMware logs to see if there too.
-Know running system harder, 
-realized issue, V12-BACKUP02 has a S: drive which is iSCSi, but it is connecting from 192.168.11.105, to 192.168.11.19 on TrueNAS, so essentially is using the management network, will reconfigure to add additional drive, and move data to iscsi04, and delete this drive.
-Ended up deleting the iSCSI disk, all storage in in VMFS

ChangeLog:
----------
All changelog was moved to document 'CHANGE CONTROL - TrueNAS - 192.168.11.19' in OneNote/Documentation/Other Documents/
