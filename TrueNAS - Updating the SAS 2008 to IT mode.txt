------------------------------------------

-Started here to get the link for the Youtube video (https://forums.serverbuilds.net/t/guide-nas-killer-4-1-supplemental-deals/2187/20)
-Wached YouTube Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7exIW_Hlyd8)
-Went to SuperMicro -> support -> Drivers, searched for X8DT6-F, selected [Windows, Windows 7 64, SAS]
-Downloaded the SAS IT firmware (PH20.0.4-IT.zip)
-Extract file
-Use Rufus, and create USB drive with FreeDOS
-Dump contents of PH20.0.4-IT\DOS onto FreeDOS USB stick
-Go to server that needs update
-Power down, pull connection to all drives, and power up with FreeDOS/IT Firmware
-list current config, take screen shot:
> sas2flsh -list

-list new config, take screen shot:
> sas2flsh -list

-Find SAS2 address, will be on the board, or from the -list: 010324BC0


-Backup current roms, (came from https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/12355769):
> sas2flash –ubios o_bios.rom
> sas2flash –ufirmware o_fw.fw
> sas2flash –o -ufwbackup o_fwb.fw
> sas2flash –o -uflash o_flash.rom
> sas2flash –o -nvdata o_nvdata.img

Upgrade fimware to IT mode
>smc2008t.bat

-Dump new roms roms:
> sas2flash –ubios n_bios.rom
> sas2flash –ufirmware n_fw.fw
> sas2flash –o -ufwbackup n_fwb.fw
> sas2flash –o -uflash n_flash.rom
> sas2flash –o -nvdata n_nvdata.img

-Check flash settings by control-C
-If looks good, power down server, re-attach drives and power up.
-save copy of ROM,FW and IMG files
-process went fine.  Also downloaded IR version of files so if want to upgrade to a SAS RAID controller in future, can do with relative ease.
