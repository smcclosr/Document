VMware - setting up SNMP monitoring
-----------------------------------

Version:	1.00
Date:		2022.01.18
Notes:		Initial build

Version:	1.01
Date:		2022.01.18
Notes:		Pulled out the passwords from the document for security reasons.

Version:	1.02
Date:		2022.01.19
Notes:		Updated the location to "xx.xxxxxx -xx.xxxxxx" from "xx.xxxxxx, -xx.xxxxxx" because the IMM will not accept a comma in the location

Version:	1.03
Date:		2023.08.05
Notes:		Used procedure on ESXi 8.0, did minor updates

Version:	1.04
Date:		Sanitized and removed all references to actual location for safety reasons.

This document was built for the monitoring of the ESXi host.  It was done once the Observium app was set up.  I will not use SNMP v2 because of the security risks.


Setting up SNMP v3
-------------------
VERSION_INITIAL: 1.00
VERSION_UPDATED: 1.04

REQUIRED:
<MONITOR_SERVER>, 192.168.11.89
<LOCATION_NAME>, Hillsborough
<LOCATION_GPS>, ** IN KEEPASS **
<MONITOR_USER>, monitor

-this document was built for vSpere ESXi 6.7, but should be very similar for other versions.  Verified and certified still works on ESXi 8.0

-Log onto the ESXi host via putty / SSH

Use vi to create this file following files:

/etc/snmp_auth
/etc/snmp_pass

In /etc/snmp_auth, enter the Password
In /etc/snmp_pass, enter the SNMP Privacy key

If you use the same passwords, you will ge the same Authhash, and Privhash

-Run the following commands

esxcli system snmp set --engineid 223322aceb
esxcli system snmp set --authentication SHA1
esxcli system snmp set --privacy AES128

-This command will generate hashes of the passwords from those two files.  My guess is that each ESXi host would generate different hashed with the same passwords. They have been obscured for security reasons
esxcli system snmp hash --auth-hash /etc/snmp_auth --priv-hash /etc/snmp_pass

Authhash: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Privhash: yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

esxcli system snmp set --users <MONITOR_USER>/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy/priv
esxcli system snmp set --v3targets <MONITOR_SERVER>@161/<MONITOR_USER>/priv/inform
esxcli system snmp set --enable true

# esxcli system snmp set --syslocation "<LOCATION_NAME>"
esxcli system snmp set --syslocation "<LOCATION_GPS>"
# esxcli system snmp set --targets=<MONITOR_SERVER>@161/<MONITOR_USER>

-For cleanup you can delete /etc/snmp_auth and /etc/snmp_pass just remember to save the contents in **KEEPASS** because will need them to add to monitor

Check values of SNMP
--------------------
	This command will show the configuarion of SNMP, feel free to compare 2 hosts, should be the same


esxcli system snmp get
