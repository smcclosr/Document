-With the newer versions of desktop windows, a recovery partition is placed after the C: partion, so expanding the partition is a little harder. these directions will enable you to backup that partition, delete it, then re-insert it.

-Open an admin command prompt, the diskpart Command will assign letter to this partition.

CMD> diskpart
DISKPART> list disk
DISKPART> select disk <the-number-of-disk-where-current-recovery-partition-locate, usually 0>
DISKPART> list partition
DISKPART> select partition <the-number-of-current-recovery-partition>
DISKPART> assign letter=O
DISKPART> exit

-This command will back up the contents of the recovery partition which is at letter O: to the file recovery-partition.wim, which is at H:\

CMD> Dism /Capture-Image /ImageFile:H:\recovery-partition.wim /CaptureDir:O:\ /Name:"Recovery"

-This will disable the recovery partition, and confirm it is disabled:

CMD> reagentc /disable
CMD> reagentc /info

-Use Diskmanager and delete the 499 MB partition of O:
-Expand C: but short it 500 MB
-Create a new simple partition of 500 MB and add letter of N:
-Now we will recover and enable the Recovery Partition, and test it is working:

CMD> Dism /Apply-Image /ImageFile:C:\recovery-partition.wim /Index:1 /ApplyDir:N:\
CMD> reagentc /setreimage /path N:\Recovery\WindowsRE
CMD> reagentc /enable
CMD> reagentc /info

-Delete recovery-partition.wim
