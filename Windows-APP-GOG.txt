Issue - Starting APP:
---------------------

-Saw this error the first time started app:

Error: connection to communication service was lost and could not be restored! gog galaxy will now shutdown

-Did some research and this eror happens when running GOG through a RDP Session.  Tested GOG on console, and error did not happen.
-Thought it might be a pi-hole issue, so looked at logs and the following sites were being blocked:

	insights-collector.gog.com
	heartbeat.dm.origin.com

-Whitelisted them, but did not resolve issue.  Then did search that revealed the RDP issue.
-Left them in for the time being because they didn't hurt anything
