Disable VMware hot Add so non system drives can be encrypted
------------------------------------------------------------

-Power off the VM
-Download the .VMX file
-Add the following line to the VMX:
devices.hotplug = "FALSE"

Issue 01: Cannot encrypt Non-OS drive with VMware guests
--------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2021.01.01
Issue: closed

-Added H: drive for urBackup and want it to also be encrypted.  Cannot, get error "The Group Policy setting for BitLocker starutp otions are in conflict and cannot be applied.  Contact your system administrator for more information"

-researched problem.
-Try 1: removing BitLocker on C: to change settings and try again.

-Resolution: Need to disable Hot add by adjusting the .VMX file. Resolution is for VMWare Workstation 5.5, but still works for ESXi 6.7
